# C Programming Exercises

### Exercise 1: The Number Guessing Game
Write a program that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 5. Tell them if they got it right or wrong!
```c
// Hint: Use scanf to get the user's guess
// The secret number is 3
```

### Exercise 2: Happy Birthday Counter
Write a program that asks for someone's age and prints "Happy Birthday!" that many times.
```c
// Hint: Use a for loop to print multiple times
```

### Exercise 3: The Pet Helper
Write a program that asks "Do you have a cat or a dog?" and then prints what sound that pet makes.
```c
// Hint: Use if statements to check which pet they have
```

### Exercise 4: Counting By Twos
Write a program that counts from 2 to 10 by twos and prints each number.
```c
// Hint: Use a loop that adds 2 each time
```

### Exercise 5: The Greeting Function
Write a function called `sayHello` that takes a person's name and prints "Hello" with their name.
```c
// Hint: The function should use printf with %s
```

### Learning Objectives
- Practice basic input/output operations
- Understand simple conditional statements

- Work with printf formatting


### Extension Activities
- Modify the number guessing game to use different numbers
- Change the pet helper to include more animals
- Add more complex greetings to the greeting function
- Create counting patterns with different numbers
- Combine multiple concepts into a single program
